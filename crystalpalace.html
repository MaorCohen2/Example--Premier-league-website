            <p>
                Crystal Palace Football Club, commonly referred to as simply Palace, 
                is a professional football club based in Selhurst, South London, England, which competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. 
                Although formally created as a professional outfit in 1905 at the Crystal Palace Exhibition building, the club's origins can be traced as far back as 1861. 
                The club used the FA Cup final stadium situated inside the grounds of the Palace for their home games between 1905 and 1915, when they were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the First World War. 
                In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.
            </p>
            <p>
                Palace spent their early years as a professional club playing in the Southern League, winning various regional titles. 
                They were elected to the Football League in 1920, and have overall mainly competed in the top two tiers of English football during their league history. 
                Since 1964, Palace have only dropped below the second tier once for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. 
                During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Palace became a force in the top flight and challenged Arsenal and Liverpool for the English league title in 1990–91, 
                but eventually ended the season in third place, the club's highest league finish to date. 
                They only missed out on qualification for the UEFA Cup at the end of that season due to the limited number of European places available to English clubs after the lifting of the UEFA ban caused by the Heysel Stadium disaster. 
                Palace also reached the FA Cup final in 1990, narrowly losing to Manchester United after a replay, and were founder members of the Premier League.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Palace went into decline after their relegation from the Premier League in 1998, 
                suffering financial problems which resulted in the club going into administration twice in 1999 and 2010. 
                They eventually recovered and were promoted back to the Premier League in 2013, where the club have remained ever since and reached another FA Cup final in 2016, 
                again finishing runners-up to Manchester United. 
                The club are currently on their longest continuous run in the top flight, achieving twelve consecutive seasons at the start of the 2024–25 campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
                The club's kit colours were claret and blue until 1973, 
                when they changed to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. 
                Palace have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with Brighton & Hove Albion, 
                and also share strong rivalries with local clubs Millwall and Charlton Athletic.

            <hr>
            <h3>The Crystal Palace Company (1854–1905)</h3>
            <p>
                In 1854, the Crystal Palace Exhibition building had been relocated from Hyde Park, 
                London, and rebuilt in an area of South London next to Sydenham Hill. 
                This area was renamed Crystal Palace which included the Crystal Palace Park that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. 
                The Crystal Palace Company who owned the exhibition building founded the Crystal Palace Club in 1857 to play cricket before turning their attention to football. 
                It had been lobbied by existing members of the cricket club to provide a continuation of sporting activities during the winter months. 
                The company formed an amateur Crystal Palace football club in 1861. 
                Many of its original players were members of the cricket club, and they shared the same pitch within the Crystal Palace Park.
            </p>
            <p>
                The amateur club became one of the original founder members of the Football Association in 1863, 
                and competed in the first FA Cup competition in 1871–72, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the Royal Engineers. 
                They played in the FA Cup over the next four seasons, but disappeared from historical records after a match against Barnes F.C. on 18 December 1875. 
                In 1895, the Football Association found a new permanent venue for the FA Cup final at the sports stadium situated inside the Palace grounds. 
                Some years later the Crystal Palace Company, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, 
                and decided to form a new professional football club to play at the stadium. 
                The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Birth of the professional club and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1905–1920)</h3>
            <p>
                The professional Crystal Palace football club was formed on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of Aston Villa assistant secretary Edmund Goodman. 
                The club applied for election to the Football League, but were rejected and instead found itself in the Southern League Second Division for the 1905–06 season. 
                Palace were successful in their inaugural season achieving promotion to the Southern League First Division, crowned as champions. 
                They also played in the mid-week United League, finishing runners-up to Watford, and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 3–0 away to New Brompton.
            </p>
            <p>
                Palace remained in the Southern League up until 1914, their one highlight the 1907 shock First Round victory over Newcastle United in the FA Cup. 
                The outbreak of the First World War led to the Admiralty requisitioning the Crystal Palace and its grounds, 
                which meant the club was forced to leave and they moved to the home of nearby West Norwood F.C. at Herne Hill Velodrome. 
                Three years later they moved again to the Nest following the demise of Croydon Common F.C..
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Into the Football League (1920–1958)</h3>
            <p>
                The club became founder members of the new Football League Third Division in the 1920–21 season, 
                finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the Second Division. 
                This achievement meant they joined Preston North End, Small Heath, Liverpool, and Bury as the only clubs at that time to have won a championship in their first season as a league club. 
                Palace then moved to a new stadium Selhurst Park in 1924, where the club still play their home games today.
            </p>
            <p>
                The opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against The Wednesday, 
                with Palace losing 0–1 in front of a crowd of 25,000. 
                Finishing in twenty-first position, the club were relegated to the Third Division South. 
                Before the Second World War, Palace made good efforts at promotion, mostly finishing in the top half of the table and were runners-up on three occasions. 
                During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two Wartime Leagues. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, 
                their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for re-election.      
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958–1973)</h3>
            <p>
                The club remained in the Third Division South up until the end of the 1957–58 season, 
                after which the league was restructured with clubs in the bottom half of the Third Division South merging with those in the bottom half of the Third Division North to form a new Fourth Division. 
                Palace had finished fourteenth – just below the cut – and were consigned to the basement of English football. 
                Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman Arthur Wait appointed the ex-Tottenham manager Arthur Rowe in April 1960, 
                and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. 
                The 1960–61 season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great Real Madrid team of that era in an historic friendly match. 
                This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play Benfica in the European Cup final. 
                A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4–3. 
                Although Rowe resigned for health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. 
                Dick Graham and then Bert Head guided Palace to successive promotions in 1963–64 and 1968–69, taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the First Division.
            </p>
            <p>
                Palace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, 
                and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5–0 home win against Manchester United in the 1972–73 season. 
                Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed Malcolm Allison as manager in March 1973, 
                with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. 
                Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Bouncing between the divisions (1973–1984)</h3>
            <p>
                After the disappointment of demotion from the top flight, 
                the next season was to prove even worse for the club. 
                Under the management of Allison, Palace suffered a second consecutive relegation, 
                and found itself back in Division Three for the 1974–75 season. 
                It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from "The Glaziers" to "The Eagles", 
                and ended its association with claret and blue kit colours by changing to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. 
                Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the 1975–76 FA Cup, beating Leeds and Chelsea along the way, 
                but lost 0–2 in the semi-final at Stamford Bridge to the eventual winners, Southampton. 
                Allison resigned at the end of the 1975–76 season after failing to get the club out of the third tier, 
                and it was under Terry Venables' management that Palace moved back up to the top flight with promotions in 1976–77 and 1978–79 the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                That team from 1979 was dubbed the "Team of the Eighties", 
                because it included a number of very talented young players who had emerged from the youth team which won the FA Youth Cup in 1976–77 and 1977–78, 
                and they were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the 1979–80 season. 
                However, financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that group of players, 
                and this ultimately led to Palace being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. 
                Palace were relegated from the First Division in 1980–81, coinciding with Ron Noades's takeover of the club. 
                They struggled back in the second tier and Noades even appointed the ex-Brighton manager Alan Mullery, which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Steve Coppell years (1984–1993)</h3>
            <p>
                On 4 June 1984, the former Manchester United and England player Steve Coppell, 
                who had recently retired from the game due to injury, was appointed as Palace manager. 
                Coppell rebuilt the club steadily over the next few years which resulted in the Eagles achieving promotion back to the top flight via the play-offs in 1988–89. 
                Palace followed this up by reaching the 1990 FA Cup final, drawing 3–3 with Manchester United after extra-time in the first match, 
                but losing the replay 0–1. The club built on this success and the 1990–91 campaign saw Palace challenge Arsenal and Liverpool for the English league title, 
                but eventually ended the season in third place to achieve their highest league finish to date. 
                Palace missed out on a European place at the end of that season partly due to the UEFA ban on English clubs caused by the Heysel Stadium disaster. 
                Though by that time the ban had been lifted, it resulted in England being unranked in the UEFA coefficient rankings used that season, 
                which meant the English top flight was only entitled to one European place in the UEFA Cup, and this went to the runners-up Liverpool. 
                The club also returned to Wembley and won the Full Members Cup, beating Everton 4–1 after extra-time in the final. During the following season, 
                star striker Ian Wright left the club to join Arsenal. 
                Palace finished tenth, and became a founding member of the new Premier League in 1992–93.
            </p>
            <p>
                Palace then sold their other top striker Mark Bright to Sheffield Wednesday, 
                and struggled to score goals throughout the next season which ended with the club relegated (Losing the final safety spot to Oldham Athletic, 
                who had a superior goal difference of -11, against Palace's -13). 
                The Eagles also finished on 49 points, which set a Premier League record that still stands today, for the highest number of points for a relegated club. 
                Coppell resigned and Alan Smith, his assistant at the club, took over as manager.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>The yo-yo years (1993–1998)</h3>
            <p>
                Alan Smith's first season as manager saw Palace win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League. 
                Their stay on this occasion proved both eventful and controversial. 
                On 25 January 1995, Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park in which United forward Eric Cantona was sent off. 
                He was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons, and retaliated with a flying kick. 
                Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail, reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal. 
                Simmons was immediately banned from Selhurst Park, and later found guilty on two charges of threatening Cantona. 
                More was to follow in March, when Palace striker Chris Armstrong was suspended by the FA for failing a drugs test. 
                On the field, Smith guided the club to the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and League Cup, 
                but their form in the league was inconsistent and Palace once again found themselves relegated, 
                finishing fourth from bottom as the Premier League was reduced from 22 to 20 clubs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Smith left the club and Steve Coppell returned as technical director in the summer of 1995, 
                and through a combination of the first-team coaching of Ray Lewington and latterly Dave Bassett's managership, 
                Palace reached the play-offs. 
                They lost the 1996 First Division play-off final in dramatic fashion when Steve Claridge scored in the last minute of extra-time for Leicester City to win 2–1. 
                The following season saw Coppell take charge as first-team manager when Bassett departed for Nottingham Forest in early 1997. 
                The club reached the play-offs for the second year running and this time achieved promotion back to the Premier League, 
                when they defeated Sheffield United 1–0 in the final at Wembley.
            </p>
            <p>
                The club's third campaign in the Premier League was no more successful than the previous two, 
                and in true yo-yo club fashion, Palace again suffered relegation back to the First Division at the end of the 1997–98 season. 
                The club also had a new owner when recruitment tycoon Mark Goldberg completed his takeover in June 1998.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Financial crisis (1998–2010)</h3>
            <p>
                Terry Venables returned to Palace for a second spell as manager and the club competed in European competition during the summer when they played in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. 
                Palace then went into administration in 1999, when owner Mark Goldberg was unable to sustain his financial backing of the club. 
                Venables left and Steve Coppell took over again as manager. 
                The club emerged from administration under the ownership of Simon Jordan, and Coppell was replaced as manager by Alan Smith for a second time. 
                Palace were almost relegated to the third tier in Jordan's first season, in 2000–01. 
                Smith was sacked in April and long-serving coach Steve Kember took over as caretaker manager and he managed to win the two remaining fixtures that would guarantee Palace survival, 
                with Dougie Freedman scoring the winner in the 87th minute on the final day of the season, 
                securing a 1–0 victory over Stockport County. 
                Former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce was appointed manager for the 2001–02 season. 
                A good start to the season gave Palace hope for a promotion challenge, but Bruce attempted to walk out on the club after just four months in charge following an approach from Birmingham City to become their new manager. 
                After a short spell on gardening leave, Bruce was eventually allowed to join Birmingham, and was succeeded by Trevor Francis, 
                who had been his predecessor at the West Midlands club.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, but he was then sacked, 
                and replaced by Steve Kember, who became permanent manager. 
                The club won their opening three games of the 2003–04 season under Kember, which put them at the top of the table, 
                but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw Palace slip towards the relegation zone. 
                Former Palace striker Iain Dowie was appointed manager and guided the club to the play-off final, 
                securing promotion with a 1–0 victory over West Ham. 
                Again Palace could not maintain their place in the top tier and were relegated on the last day of the season after drawing at local rivals Charlton Athletic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following that relegation, Simon Jordan was unable to put the club on a sound financial footing over the next few years, 
                and in January 2010, Palace were once again placed in administration, this time by a creditor. 
                Due to the Football League's regulations, the club were deducted ten points, 
                and the administrators P&A Partnership were forced to sell key players including Victor Moses and José Fonte. 
                Neil Warnock had also departed as manager in the early part of 2010. 
                He had been appointed in 2007, replacing the former Palace favourite Peter Taylor who had a brief spell as manager. 
                Paul Hart took over as caretaker manager for the final weeks of the season. 
                Survival in the Championship was only secured on the final day of the season after a memorable 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday, 
                which was itself relegated as a result.

            <p>
                During the close of that season, CPFC 2010, a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans, 
                successfully negotiated the purchase of the club. 
                They were led by Steve Parish, the vocal representative for the consortium of four that also included Stephen Browett, 
                Jeremy Hosking and Martin Long. Crucially, 
                the consortium also secured the freehold of Selhurst Park, and paid tribute to a fans' campaign which helped pressure Lloyds Bank into selling the ground back to the club.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Established back in the Premier League (2010–present)</h3>
            <p>
                The CPFC 2010 consortium swiftly installed George Burley as the new Palace manager. 
                However a poor start to the following season saw the club hovering around the bottom of the table by December. 
                On 1 January 2011, after a 0–3 defeat to Millwall, Burley was sacked and his assistant Dougie Freedman named caretaker manager. 
                Just over a week later Freedman was appointed manager on a full-time basis. 
                Palace moved up the table and by securing a 1–1 draw at Hull City on 30 April, 
                the club was safe from relegation with one game of the season left. 
                After another year and a half as manager, Freedman departed to manage Bolton Wanderers on 23 October 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
                In November 2012, Ian Holloway became the new Palace manager. 
                He guided the club back to the Premier League after an eight-year absence by defeating Watford 1–0 in the Championship play-off final at the new Wembley, 
                but resigned in October 2013. 
                Following a brief spell under Tony Pulis, and an unsuccessful second tenure for Neil Warnock, 
                former Palace player Alan Pardew was confirmed as the new manager in January 2015. 
                In his first full season, Pardew led the club to the 2016 FA Cup final, their first for 26 years. 
                Palace met Manchester United who they had lost to in the 1990 final, and the Eagles suffered disappointment again losing 1–2 after extra-time. 
                In December 2016, Pardew was sacked and replaced by Sam Allardyce, who kept the club in the Premier League, but resigned unexpectedly at the end of the season. 
                On 26 June 2017, Palace appointed Frank de Boer as their first permanent foreign manager. 
                He was dismissed after only 77 days in charge, with the club having lost their first four league games at the start of the 2017–18 season while failing to score in any of them. 
                Former England manager Roy Hodgson was appointed as the club's new manager the next day. 
                Palace finished in eleventh-place in the Premier League in Hodgson's first season, twelfth in the 2018–19 season and fourteenth the following season.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 18 May 2021, the club announced Hodgson would be leaving at the end of the 2020–21 season, 
                upon the expiration of his contract, having achieved a second consecutive fourteenth-place. 
                On 4 July 2021, Palace appointed the former Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira as their new manager on a three-year contract. 
                Despite guiding the club to an FA Cup semi-final and a twelfth-place league finish in his first season, Vieira was sacked during the next campaign on 17 March 2023, 
                after a winless run of 12 games left the club three points above the relegation zone.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 21 March 2023, Hodgson was re-appointed Palace manager until the end of the season. 
                He guided the club to safety, finishing comfortably in eleventh place. 
                On 3 July, Hodgson was appointed permanent manager for a second time, 
                though he stepped down from the role prematurely on 19 February 2024. 
                He was replaced by former Eintracht Frankfurt and VfL Wolfsburg manager Oliver Glasner. 
                The club achieved a strong finish at the end of the 2023–24 season under Glasner, equalling their highest Premier League finish of tenth place, 
                and highest points total of 49. 
                Subsequently, four Palace players (Ebere Eze, Marc Guéhi, Dean Henderson and Adam Wharton) were named in the English national team for Euro 2024, 
                more than any other Premier League club for England at the tournament.

            <h2>Stadiums</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                In 1905, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the FA Cup final venue situated inside the grounds of The Crystal Palace, 
                wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. 
                They formed a new professional Crystal Palace football club to play at the stadium. 
                When the First World War broke out, the Palace and grounds were seized by the armed forces, and in 1915 the club were forced to move by the Admiralty. 
                They found a temporary base at the Herne Hill Velodrome. 
                Although other clubs offered the use of their grounds to Palace, the club felt it best to remain as close to their natural catchment area as possible. 
                When Croydon Common F.C. were wound up in 1917, Palace took over their old stadium located at the Nest. 
                In 1919, they began the purchase of the land on which they would eventually build Selhurst Park, their current home.
            </p>
            <p>
                The renowned stadium architect Archibald Leitch was employed to draw up plans, 
                and the construction of Selhurst Park was completed in time for the 1924–25 season. 
                The stadium remained relatively unchanged, with only the introduction of floodlights and some maintenance improvements until 1969, 
                when the Arthur Wait Stand was built. 
                The Main Stand became all-seater in the summer of 1981 and more work followed in the next few years, 
                when the Whitehorse Lane End was redeveloped to allow for a Sainsbury's supermarket, club offices and a club shop. 
                The Arthur Wait Stand became all-seater in 1990, and in 1994 the Holmesdale Terrace was replaced with a new two tier stand.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Selhurst Park's record attendance was set in 1979, with an official total of 51,482. 
                After all the redevelopments to the ground and safety requirements due to the Taylor Report, the current capacity is 25,486.   
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2011, proposals were put forward to move the club back to their original home at the Crystal Palace National Stadium, 
                but after the club gained promotion to the Premier League in 2013, 
                there has been a renewed focus on redeveloping Selhurst Park into a 40,000 seater stadium. 
                Revised plans for a new 13,500-seater Main Stand (extending overall stadium capacity to 34,000) were approved at a Croydon Council meeting on 19 April 2018. 
                However these plans were subsequently delayed firstly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and latterly the club's focus on delivering its Academy upgrade at Beckenham which was completed in 2021. 
                When the club finally began to push again for the stand redevelopment, further delays occurred due to opposition to the demolition of houses in nearby Wooderson Close. 
                The club signed a legal agreement to provide replacement homes to relocate residents. 
                In August 2024, the expansion of the Main Stand was re-approved by Croydon Council and preliminary works commenced with proposed completion by the summer of 2027.
